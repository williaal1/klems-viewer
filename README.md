# KLEMS Viewer

The US economy in 2017 as a bookcase of 63 industries. Each sphere is sized by value added. Click one to see its production function as seven pages:

- **Overview**
- **K**: capital
- **L**: labor
- **E**: energy
- **M**: materials
- **S**: purchased services
- **C**: carbon, an output

## Every mapping and conversion

**Industry codes**

| From → to | How |
|---|---|
| **KLEMS industry (63)**, the spine | BEA production-account codes (`111CA`, `325`, `GF`, …), from the account's own NAICS mapping sheet |
| KLEMS → BLS capital-detail sector (61) | NAICS ranges (`311-312`, `44,45`, …), matched by name: 61/61 private industries. Government has no BLS capital detail. `pipeline/crosswalk.csv` |
| KLEMS → OEWS industry + ownership (62) | 2017 OEWS codes (NAICS 2012 basis) in `pipeline/crosswalk.csv`. Rules below this table. |
| BEA detail I-O industry (402) → BEA summary (71) | EPA USEEIO `sector_crosswalk.csv` (`bea_detail` → `bea_summary`) |
| BEA summary (71) → KLEMS (63) | 58 codes identical. 13 merge: `441 445 452 4A0` → `44RT`; `622 623` → `622HO`; `HS ORE` → `531`; `GFGD GFGN GFE` → `GF`; `GSLG GSLE` → `GSL` |
| EPA USEEIO summary sector (71) → KLEMS (63) | Same 13 merges (EPA uses BEA summary codes) |

OEWS rules for the KLEMS → OEWS row:
- Private industries use private ownership (`5`).
- `713` and `721` exist only as private + local government (`57`) and are used as is.
- Federal = `999101`; State & local = `999201` + `999301`, including government schools and hospitals.
- Farms: none, because OEWS doesn't survey them.
- Fishing (`114`) is absent from 2017.

**Grouping**

| From → to | How |
|---|---|
| KLEMS industry → shelf (16 kinds of industry) | BEA sector from the EPA crosswalk, with manufacturing split. Nondurable: `311FT 313TT 315AL 322 323 324 325 326`; the rest of manufacturing is durable. A merged KLEMS industry takes its parts' sector. |
| I-O commodity (394) → group → band (E/M/S tables) | Detail commodity → BEA summary commodity (EPA crosswalk) → BEA sector (same 16 bands, plus "Noncomparable imports & adjustments" and "Scrap & used goods") |
| Occupation (SOC 2010) → supervisory / nonsupervisory | Supervisory = SOC major group 11 (management) + the 18 occupations titled "…Supervisors…". Everything else is nonsupervisory. |

**E / M / S classification of purchases**

BEA assigns E, M and S at an unpublished finer level, so this is an approximation. It is shown beside BEA's published totals, never scaled to them.

| Commodity | Class |
|---|---|
| `211000` oil & gas, `212100` coal, `221100` electric power, `221200` natural gas distribution, `324110` refineries | **E** |
| … except crude and petroleum products (`211000 324110 324121 324122 324190`) bought by refining (`324`) or chemicals (`325`); and `211000` bought by oil & gas extraction (`211`) | **M** (feedstock / own use) |
| Every other commodity coded `1…`, `2…` or `3…` except construction `23…` (this includes water & sewage, `221300`) | **M** |
| Everything else: construction, trade, transport, services, government, noncomparable imports, scrap & used, rest-of-world adjustment | **S** |

**Value conversions**

| Quantity | Conversion |
|---|---|
| Value added (sphere size) | Production-account value added = capital + labor compensation. It is not GDP-by-industry value added: the 63 sum to $19,762bn vs $19,612bn GDP. Sphere area ∝ value added. |
| K by asset class | Six tangible classes + intellectual property (software + R&D + artistic originals, from K by type) = K |
| Capital stocks | BLS 2017 chained dollars = current dollars, since 2017 is the base year, so asset stocks add up. Shares of capital income are fractions. |
| Wages across merged industries | Jobs summed. Mean wage weighted by jobs. Medians and percentiles are not combinable, so not shown. Wage bill = jobs × mean wage, set against KLEMS labor compensation. |
| OEWS repeated rows | Duplicate (code, ownership, occupation) rows dropped after checking that no two published values disagree |
| Purchases | Purchasers' prices: margins folded into goods, as BEA values KLEMS inputs. Each industry's total = production-account E + M + S within 0.2%. |
| Emissions by gas | Direct = EPA `B` (kg per $, by flow) × output `x` × AR6 GWP. Flows grouped as CO₂, methane, nitrous oxide, fluorinated (all HFCs, PFCs, SF₆, NF₃). Sum over gases = EPA `D·x`. |
| Emissions per dollar | Direct `D`, and with supply chain `N` (kg CO₂e per $ of EPA output), averaged over a merged industry by output. Supply-chain figures are never summed across industries. |
| Short names, emoji | `pipeline/short_names.csv`, `pipeline/emoji.csv` (editable) |

## Rebuild

`pipeline/build_industries.py` and `pipeline/build_readout.py` read from a local data library that is not in this repo. Each stops on a failed check: identities, totals, crosswalk coverage.
